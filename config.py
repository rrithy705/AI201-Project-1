# ─── Chunking (Milestone 3) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `chunker.py::split_documents` splits city_guides on its `##` section
# headings, so these two are no longer a window and a slide.
#
# CHUNK_SIZE is a CEILING. Measured across the corpus, the 84 sections run
# 175–710 characters (median 294), so nothing reaches it and no section gets
# cut. It exists so the strategy degrades sensibly on a longer document
# instead of emitting one enormous chunk.
#
# CHUNK_OVERLAP applies only beneath that ceiling, inside `_split_oversized`.
# Between sections the overlap is zero on purpose: a heading is already the
# point where the topic changes, so there is no half-sentence to protect.

TOP_K = 5               # how many chunks to pull back per question

# The relevance gate. If the best chunk is further away than this, the system
# refuses to answer instead of handing the model thin material.
#
# LOWER IS BETTER: 0.3 is a close match, 0.9 is unrelated.
#
# Measured on city_guides at the section chunking above (Milestone 4):
#
#   the five in QUESTIONS          0.216 – 0.386
#   the five in OUT_OF_SCOPE       0.810 – 0.969
#
# A gap 0.42 wide. Its midpoint is about 0.60, and 0.70 sits deliberately
# nearer the top of it, because a third group decided the number: questions
# this corpus *does* answer, asked loosely — "do I need cash?", "anywhere good
# for a rainy day?", "is it worth bringing a car?" — come back at 0.637, 0.616
# and 0.688. The shipped 0.6 refuses all three, and the answers are sitting in
# guide_marchwood.md, guide_brightwater.md and guide_regional_transport.md.
# 0.70 admits them and still refuses all five out-of-scope questions with 0.11
# to spare.

#
# Setting it to any other name — unit 2's "try a second embedding model"
# stretch option — switches to loading that model from Hugging Face instead,
# which needs `pip install 'sentence-transformers>=3.4,<3.5'` first. store.py
